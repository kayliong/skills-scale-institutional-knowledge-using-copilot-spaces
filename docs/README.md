# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme uses an iterative, stakeholder-focused approach to plan, execute, and improve cross-functional projects. Our project management processes are built on the following key principles:

- **Customer-First Mindset**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative Delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback
- **Clear Ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Align stakeholders early and maintain regular communication
- **Continuous Learning**: Capture learnings through retrospectives and convert them into actionable improvements
- **Measured Outcomes**: Make data-informed decisions and track impact based on evidence

## Core Lifecycle

Our project management lifecycle consists of six key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, define problem statement, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, create prioritized backlog, identify dependencies, and define release milestones
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Manage day-to-day delivery through standups, track progress, ensure quality, and escalate blockers
4. **Risk Management & Communication**: Identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks; maintain stakeholder communication
5. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy features to production following standardized processes with rollback plans
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and implement actionable improvements
